Course Materials
Textbook: Privitera, G. J. (2012). Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences. Sage Publications. ISBN: 9781412969314
You will need to bring this textbook to your recitation sections.
Clicker: Turning Technology, ISBN: 9781934931400
Clicker questions will be asked in lecture for extra credit points. You are not required to purchase a clicker, but I hope you do because, in addition to allowing you to earn extra credit points, it will enhance your learning experience and help me to focus attention on the material with which you have the most trouble.
Calculator: You will need a simple calculator capable (at a minimum) of computing square roots. An inexpensive solar-powered scientific calculator would be preferable, since these allow the use of parentheses, have a dedicated squaring function, and are unlikely to run out of power in the middle of an exam. I recommend the Texas Instruments TI-30X IIS, which can be purchased online for under $15. Note: even if you have calculator functions on your smartphone or computer, you will need this calculator for exams. You will not be permitted to use phones or laptops during the exams.
Access to a PC: You will need internet access to view course materials on the Sakai site.</first_page>

Course Description
This course attempts to survey and explain some of the variety found in the human condition around the world. It is both a scientific and a humanistic endeavor to explain differences and similarities in appearance, language, culture, and perspectives. It incorporates basic biology and physiology, history, geography, sociology, evolution, and sometimes a suspended value judgment, in order to understand why people are who they are, and why they do what they do.

(NOTE: This syllabus will cover the most recent, 12th edition, but the 11th edition will be fine, as well as cheaper for you. If you get the 11th edition, however, realize that YOU will be responsible for making sure the chapters you read correspond to the correct topics in the syllabus—I include the chapter headings in the syllabus to help you with that. Don’t go back earlier than the 11th edition; things do change in Anthropology).

Learning Goals for Economics Majors See the Department website at the following:
http://economics.rutgers.edu/undergraduate/courses-and-syllabi/learning-goals
Goals Introduction to Macroeconomic Theory
Students who satisfactorily complete Introduction to Macroeconomic Theory will understand and be able to articulate the core principles, concepts and theories of modern macroeconomics (the basic aggregate demand and supply model, the multiplier, the Keynesian, Classical and Monetarist models, the open-economy macro model, neo-classical and new growth theory, etc). Students will begin to develop the ability to interpret and analyze economic data such as aggregate output, inflation, unemployment and growth rates. Through lectures, discussions, assignments and readings students will become familiar with the theoretical framework of macroeconomics and learn to apply it to the analysis of macroeconomic policy issues.
The following is a course outline which is subject to change.

Please practice writing in a professional succinct manner during all e-mail correspondence (i.e., be polite, direct, and mature).
Teaching Assistants: Are here to help you succeed in this class. After drop/add week, each student will be given a student # that is associated with your designated TA group. During classes, we will break out into T.A. groups for purposes of in-class activities, group discussion, group assignments, and portions of exam reviews. Your instructor will float across groups to provide feedback and answer questions. You are expected to behave in a professional and on-task manner at all times during class, when unsure how to behave, follow your TA’s guidance for the tone and style for group discussions.

COURSE DESCRIPTION
The purpose of "Introduction to comparative literature" is twofold: to make students familiar with different methodologies that can be adopted to analyze literary texts, and to examine what it means to compare literary texts.
Through representative essays, the course will offer a systematic exploration of the major theoretical approaches to literature, from formalism and structuralism, through psychoanalysis, Marxism, post-structuralism, feminism, post-colonialism and cultural studies.
A selection of literary works belonging to a variety of national, cultural, and linguistic traditions will also allow us to apply and test literary theory in a comparative perspective.
Meetings will be a combination of lecture and seminar format, depending on the topic and the purpose of each class.
COURSE MATERIAL
A coursepack with copies of all required readings is available for purchase at the Copying Services of Lauinger Library, 2nd floor. It will be each student’s responsibility to get a copy of the coursepack, to prepare the material assigned for each meeting (see details in the calendar below), and to bring it to class.
Secondary sources
Additional critical material on comparative literature, literary theory, literary periods and authors covered in the course will be recommended whenever appropriate. Please feel also free to consult with the instructor at any time to discuss further readings you may want to pursue according to your individual interests and needs.
The following texts can guide you to a deeper examination of the objectives and problems of comparative literature as a discipline and a methodology:</first_page>

            <first_page>INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY SYLLABUS

            <first_page>History 103: U.S. Intellectual History since the Civil War, Fall 2007
Time and Location: Fri. 10–12, 332 Giannini Hall
Instructor: Daniel Immerwahr
E-mail: daniel_immerwahr@berkeley.edu
Office Hours: Tues. 10–12 or by appt., 2116 Dwinelle
Website: http://webfiles.berkeley.edu/~daniel_immerwahr/103.html
Course Description:
This course traces the history of the United States since the Civil War through its ideas. How have intellectuals understood, reacted to, or participated in such developments as the growth of the corporation, imperialism, Jim Crow segregation, the wars of the twentieth century, the United States’ rise to global prominence, and the social movements of the 1960s? How has the role of intellectuals changed with the growth of the university, the rise of the planners, and the emergence of novel sources of information? Such questions will be explored as we read a variety of primary texts from the period and scholarship in the field of intellectual history.
The course will be focused on two activities. First, students will read a blend of primary and secondary sources and discuss them in class. Second, they will engage in a number of explorations of individually-chosen primary sources from the period and write short memos explaining how those sources fit into the broader patterns of U.S. history. By the end of the course, students will have read widely in the primary sources of the period and have had ample practice doing original work in intellectual history.
The assigned reading will include texts by and about such prominent U.S. intellectuals as William James, Thorstein Veblen, W. E. B. Du Bois, John Dewey, Margaret Mead, and Thomas S. Kuhn and on such classic topics as pragmatism, Darwinism, science, political economy, race, culture, and democracy. Through their individual work, however, students will also be encouraged to investigate the more eclectic and minor aspects of intellectual history—science fiction, pedagogy, mathematics, environmentalism, jazz, legal theory, etc.
Students who have taken History 132B before or concurrently with this class will no doubt benefit, but 132B is not a required prerequisite. Students who plan to take a 101 after this course will be asked to prepare a short, nonbinding pre-prospectus. Note: this course will feature a fair amount of work, but that work will be evenly spaced throughout the semester.
Course Requirements:
Reading for Class:
Each week, you will be assigned to read somewhere between 100–150 pages (reading for some weeks
will fall outside of this range) of text for class. You are expected to read these assignments carefully and to be prepared to discuss them, so bring your books as well as any notes you have made. It would be helpful if you could note important passages, questions that occurred to you, or other items of interest that you would like to introduce into the class discussions.
Reading Responses
To help you focus your reading, you will be responsible for writing a paragraph-length reading response every week and sending it to me by e-mail (daniel_immerwahr@berkeley.edu) by midnight before each class. Unless otherwise indicated, your reading responses should propose an item for class discussion and give reasons why you would like to discuss that item. Reading responses needn’t be formal or exhaustive. You are only required to submit one reading response per week, not one reading response per assigned text.
Class Participation
Seminars work best when their members listen attentively, participate actively, and treat each other with respect. You will be graded on all of those criteria. If you feel that discussions are not running the way you would like them to run, please talk to me about it or send me an e-mail.</first_page>
